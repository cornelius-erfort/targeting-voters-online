# Targeting Voters Online: How Parties' Campaigns Differ

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the research article *"Targeting Voters Online: How Parties' Campaigns Differ"* by **Cornelius Erfort**, Post-doctoral Researcher at the University of Witten/Herdecke, Department of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.

The paper investigates how political parties use digital platforms like Facebook and Instagram to target voters during election campaigns, focusing on the 2019 European Parliament elections. It includes a comprehensive dataset of over 100,000 ads from 148 political parties, exploring differences in campaign strategies, especially between smaller niche parties and larger mainstream parties. 

The findings contribute to the broader discussion on voter targeting and digital campaign regulation.
